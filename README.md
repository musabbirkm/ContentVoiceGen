    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install gradio requests edge-tts google-generativeai nest_asyncio
    ```
3. set your API key in the VOCALIS.py file.
4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```


5. Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Gradio (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
